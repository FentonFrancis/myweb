            <h2>The Cheetah</h2>
            <p>One of the most recognizable animals in Kenya is the cheetah. These sporty cats, each with their own unique spots, are skilled hunters in part because of their speed and agility. In fact, cheetahs are the fastest mammals on earth; they can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in just three seconds. Another interesting fact is that, like lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards, cheetahs can't roar.</p>
            <p>These cats hunt in open grasslands across Africa. They can be found in countries including Kenya, Algeria, South Africa, and Niger.</p>
            <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies cheetahs as vulnerable, which means that this species is at high risk of extinction in the wild. There are just about 5,651 mature cheetahs left in the wild, and their population is decreasing, particularly at risk from habitat loss because they need such a large range. Most cheetahs live in unprotected areas where they come into conflict with farmers.</p>
