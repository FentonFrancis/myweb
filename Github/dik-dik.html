            <h2>The Dik-dik</h2>
            <p>The dik-dik is a type of antelope that lives in arid regions of East Africa. They can live in such environments because they get water from the vegetation they eat. They also take cover in undergrowth to protect themselves from predators including eagles and carts.</p>
            <p>There are four species of dik-dik, but just two of them live in Kenya. These include Guenthas dik-diks and Kirk's dik-diks, though they are still small in comparison to other antelopes. They stand at just 45 centimeters tall and weigh only 7.2 kilograms. Guenthas dik-dik is smaller but has a larger snout.</p>
            <p>The IUCN lists both dik-diks as of least concern and as having a stable population, though they are threatened by hunters, diseases, and drought.</p>
