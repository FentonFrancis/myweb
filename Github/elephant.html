                <h2>The African Elephant</h2>
                <p>The African elephant, the world's largest land mammal, inhabits many different habitats including open savannahs, deserts, and forests. As these animals roam, they play an important role within their ecosystem; they disperse seeds through their dung, helping to fertilize the land. They clear paths through vegetation and overgrown bushes, promoting plant diversity, and they use their tusks to access water, creating small watering holes for other animals.</p>
                <p>African elephants are found in 23 countries across Africa, with large populations in Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>However, the African elephant is classified as endangered, meaning it is at a very high risk of extinction. The numbers are decreasing due to poaching for ivory and the conversion of their natural habitats into agricultural land and infrastructure by expanding human populations. Efforts are being made to protect African elephants through various initiatives.</p>
